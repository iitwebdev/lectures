    3  In the decorator:
    9    Get any args that RegexDispatch captured
10-11    Create request and response wrappers
   12    Call the function with the request and args
   13    Check the return value:
   14      Is it a Response object?  If so, use that
           Otherwise, treat the return value as a body
   15    Take the status and headers from the response object
   16    Let the response object convert any unicode in the body
39-48      and return that converted value
