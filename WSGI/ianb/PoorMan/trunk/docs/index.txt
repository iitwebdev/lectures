Poor Man
--------

PoorMan is an experiment in making a More Decoupled Framework.  It
uses `Routes <http://routes.groovie.org/>`_ to map URL paths to
object.  It uses decorators to make simple functions into WSGIish
objects.  

It tries to be clean and small, so you don't import from any
subframeworks (even from PoorMan except for one import); it integrates
other projects, but without letting them leak into your application or
making you understand each piece.  Well, at least that's what it tries
to do.
