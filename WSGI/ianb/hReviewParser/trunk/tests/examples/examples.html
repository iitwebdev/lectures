<div class="example">
  <h2>Review from boogdesign.com</h2>

  Example in the wild...

  <div id="boogdesign">
    <div class="hreview">
      <p><span class="vevent item">
        <abbr class="dtreviewed fn" title="2007-02-28">
          <strong class="summary">Accessible Flash from
            <a href="http://niquimerret.com/">Niqui Merret</a>
          </strong>
        </abbr>,
        <abbr class="dtstart" title="2007-02-28T19:00:00">19:00</abbr>
        to <abbr class="dtend" title="2007-02-28T19:30:00">19:30</abbr>
        <a href="#wsgembed" class="include"></a>
      </span></p>

    <div class="description"><p>Niqui started off with some
justification. many web developers believe that Flash can never be
accessible, and this is not true.  Flash has a lot of built in support
for accessibility such as access keys, labels and captions, and in
addition can be used to <a href="http://osflash.org/flashaid">detect
the presence of a screen reader</a> (if you're using IE on
Windows...).  It is also a misconception that a block of HTML content
is necessarily more accessible than a Flash movie - the phrase 'a
picture is worth a thousand words' can be applied here, some disabled
users will have far more trouble reading a large block of text than
they would assimilating an animation.</p>

    <p>No technology is 100% accessible, but the process of making
Flash as accessible as possible is the same as with any other
technology - identify the barriers stopping people accessing your
content and work out how to get around them.  Flash has a number of
built in mechanisms to help the developer overcome barriers - as
previously mentioned it can communicate with screen readers and notify
it of content updates, it can be keyboard driven and labels can be
added which will be read out.  Niqui then showed us a demo of a simple
accessible Flash game she'd built, using it with a screen reader and
keyboard, and showed us some other useful tricks which were possible -
dynamically adjusting/inverting colours and contrast in the movie, and
a simple script which allowed the movie to scale as the browser font
size was changed.  She also had some interesting points about the
relationship between Flash and standards - there aren't going to be
any standards for accessible Flash content until the 'standards
people' accept Flash.</p>

    <p>Niqui was enthusiastic about her subject matter and had
excellent presentation skills, the talk was a definite eye opener in
some respects, but Flash was unfortunately the thing I was least
interested in so <span><span class="rating">4</span> out of
