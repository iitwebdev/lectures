    "description": "<p><span class=\"fn org\">Crepes on Cole</span> is one of the best little creperies in <span class=\"adr\"><span class=\"locality\">San Francisco</span></span>. Excellent food and service. Plenty of tables in a variety of sizes for parties large and small. Window seating makes for excellent people watching to/from the N-Judah which stops right outside. I've had many fun social gatherings here, as well as gotten plenty of work done thanks to neighborhood WiFi.</p>",
