<p>A regular meeting of the Python Software Foundation (&quot;PSF&quot;) Board of
Directors was held over Internet Relay Chat beginning at 18:00 UTC, 13
March 2006.  Stephan Deibel presided at the meeting.</p>
<div class="section">

(arrived at 18:45).  Also in attendance was Neal Norwitz (Assistant

Domain: N. Norwitz will ask the lawyer about the python.com domain.</p>
<p>N. Norwitz sent an email report earlier.  In summary, he spoke with
our lawyers, and got the answer we were expecting: that it's going
to be difficult.  The recommendation was to try to buy the domain.</p>
<p>The consensus of the board was that it wasn't worth the time, which
none of us have, or the effort.</p>

(S. Holden):</p>

transformed for the new system and which parts still require
conversion;</li>
<li>complete the documentation so that webmaster team members can
use the new system rather than the old one.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>S. Deibel summarized: &quot;The site was rolled out after the sprint at
PyCon and further work is in the hands of the community via
psf.pollenation.org.  Many of the sprinters and Tim [Parkin] are
continuing fairly intensive work.&quot;</p>
<p>D. Ascher commented that although switching was good, he was not
impressed with the &quot;cleanliness&quot; of the switch; lots of 404s,
broken URLs, etc.  D. Goodger thought there was too much attempted
all at once.  S. Deibel agreed that it could have been done better,
but thought it was worth the pain/breakage (which should mostly be
fixed by now).  M. von Löwis noted that the pydotorgers will fix
what got broken over time.</p>
<p>D. Goodger suggested a debrief/post-mortem at some point; &quot;I think
we can learn a lot from this&quot;.</p>
<p>D. Ascher wanted to know how we're going to enroll people outside
the pydotorgers to help with content, and noted that Fredrik Lundh
has a good point worth hearing.  M. von Löwis agreed, noting that
there is a much broader issue, which is whether &quot;wider&quot; involvement
that Fredrik wants should be done.  B. Cannon noted that this is
going to require simplifying the building of the site by
maintainers.</p>
<p>Further discussion was moved to email.</p>

<h2><a id="donation-to-freenode-net" name="donation-to-freenode-net">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donation to freenode.net</a></h2>
<p>In a 28 February 2006 message to the PSF-board mailing list, Steve
Holden suggested donating $250 to freenode.net, which hosts the IRC
channels used for board meetings and other Python-related discussions.
There was general agreement, but no motion was put forth.  Deferred
due to the absence of the proposal's champion.</p>

<h2><a id="paying-the-treasurer-or-offload-tasks-to-paid-service" name="paying-the-treasurer-or-offload-tasks-to-paid-service">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying the Treasurer or Offload Tasks to Paid Service</a></h2>
<p>N.&nbsp;Norwitz summarized:</p>
<blockquote>
When picking up the treasurer tasks, it seems there is always a
lot of work at the beginning.  Some of it is learning, some of it
is finishing the outstanding work.  Part of what makes things hard
is that many things only happen once a year.  Pycon usually
creates lots of work because things have changed (and broken) over
the last year.  I tried to document a bunch and be available for
answering questions, but it's always hard.  I went from zero
automation to 50%, I think Kurt has brought that up to about 90%.
So hopefully it won't continue to be as much work going forward.</blockquote>
<p>S. Deibel asked if it is OK to pay the treasurer or only to pay for
services?  M. von Löwis replied that the board should offer something,
e.g. compensation by the hour.  If the workload decreases, the
compensation will also decrease.  T. Peters noted that if the PSF
becomes an employer, we have to take on a lot more fiddly paperwork.
D. Ascher suggested buying the treasurer a computer.  S. Deibel noted
that we need to be careful about violating rules about non-salary
compensation for officers.</p>
<p>The board was generally in favor, but discussion was deferred to
email.  <span class="action">Kurt Kaiser is to propose compensation for the
treasurer.</span></p>

<h2><a id="post-pycon-report" name="post-pycon-report">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-PyCon Report</a></h2>
<p>A. Kuchling sent a detailed report on &quot;PyCon status&quot; to the PSF-board
mailing list.  In summary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The hotel has offered two later date options, contingent on
renegotiating a few contract clauses.</li>
<li>The raw data from the conference feedback forms is available.</li>
<li>PyCon 2006 broke even, give or take a few thousand dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p>A. Kuchling asked: <em>should</em> PyCon be profit-making?  S. Deibel replied
that profit is nice but not at all necessary.  D. Goodger opined that
the goal should be break-even or a slight profit, but we accept a
loss.  M. von Löwis: &quot;a break even is fine with me&quot;.  T. Peters stated
the PyCon goal of &quot;low-cost community conference&quot;, which had general
agreement.  S. Holden noted that on a budget of $100,000 the profit or
loss could be $20,000 -- we can't plan more closely than that.
D. Ascher: &quot;I don't think we should make a profit, but we should be
wary of running big losses&quot;; there was general agreement with this
statement.</p>
<p>D. Ascher observed that the move out of DC was because we were running
out of room at GWU, and we haven't grown, making the move apparently
pointless.  S. Holden noted that the 2006 event showed the advantages
of a hotel venue, even though it's more expensive; D. Ascher was not
convinced.  S. Holden and D. Goodger noted that the evidence is that
growth would have continued at the previous venue, which was at
capacity (or over, taking the 2-floor split into account), so DC 2006
would not have worked.  S. Deibel noted his opinion that moving the
conference around is a Good Thing.</p>
<p>A. Kuchling mentioned that he would like to weblog PyCon's final
statement of profit &amp; loss.  M. von Löwis cautioned providing too much
detail.  It was agreed that a statement of the final balance would be
sufficient.</p>
