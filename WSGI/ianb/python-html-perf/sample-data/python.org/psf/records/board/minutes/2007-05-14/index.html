meeting, as highlighted in the minutes (Section 3, Status of Past
Action Items):</p>
<ol class="arabic">

link ideas.</span></p>

D. Goodger will consult the PSF's lawyer to ask if the
proxy forms and absentee ballots from the members' meeting should
be kept or destroyed.</p>
<p>Van Lindberg replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Best practice is to keep the ballots.  501c organizations
should be run like a regular company, so they are still
required to have (and keep) articles, bylaws, board minutes,
etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D. Goodger will put the forms and ballots in an envelope, seal it,
and file it.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" id="frank-willison-award" name="frank-willison-award">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank Willison Award</a></h2>
<p>D.&nbsp;Goodger reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got a reply from O'Reilly.  They just need a name from us, and
Betsy Waliszewski will handle the certificate &amp; the prize (a pass
to OSCON).  One month's notice prior to OSCON is enough for
O'Reilly -- so we should target mid-June... which is coming up
fast.  I will coordinate this with Betsy Waliszewski of O'Reilly.</p>
<p>I suggest asking Guido and past winners for candidates, then
bringing it to the Board for a vote.  If we go this route,
obviously current PSF Directors and Officers either would not be
eligible, or [nominees] would have to recuse themselves.</p>
<p>As for the recipient having to be present at OSCON, that was a
misunderstanding.  Nat Torkington just wants to know in advance if
the person will be there or not, to avoid confusion when
presenting the award.  It's okay to award to someone in absentia.</p>
<p>I asked about the possiblitiy of funding the OSCON travel &amp; hotel
of the recipient.  Betsy Waliszewski and Nat Torkington will get
back to us on that.</p>
<p>I will set up a page on www.python.org to list the recipients of
the Frank Willison Award.  I'd like to include photos of
recipients with their awards.  Andrew Kuchling has a couple of
photos up on his site and on Flickr, and I'd like to get photos of
the other recipients too.</p>
<p>Betsy Waliszewski sent a 2006 certificate to Alex Martelli.  I
informed Anna that it would be arriving.  She intercepted it,
noticed that the wording was strange (&quot;for his outstanding
contribution to the python community in 2006&quot;), and asked Betsy to
redo it (remove &quot;in 2006&quot;, and add the date separately).  A
revised certificate has been received and presented to Alex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Board agreed with the suggested approach to selecting recipients,
and that any Directors nominated should recuse themselves from
deliberations.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" id="europython-sponsorship" name="europython-sponsorship">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EuroPython Sponsorship</a></h2>
<p>Andrew Kuchling has been discussing PSF assistance with the EuroPython
organizers.  Separately, Guido van Rossum wrote to D. Goodger
suggesting that the PSF become a sponsor and backer of EuroPython.  In
email, Steve Holden proposed that the PSF sponsor up to $5000.
S. Deibel noted that a &quot;Gold&quot; sponsorship is 2000 euros, and they
don't seem to have platinum.  The Board agreed that the PSF should
sponsor beyond the Gold level.</p>
<blockquote>
RESOLVED, that the PSF will provide up to US $5000 as a sponsor of
EuroPython 2007.</blockquote>
<p>Approved 6-0-0.</p>
<p>D. Goodger noted that we need to formulate a policy regaring event
sponsorships.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" id="pycon-uno-italy" name="pycon-uno-italy">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PyCon Uno (Italy)</a></h2>
<p>S. Deibel reported that Valentino Volonghi contacted him to ask if
they can use the logo.  We don't have a PSF logo though so he gave
permission to use the Python logo.  S. Deibel checked and reported the
logo in use (at <a class="reference" href="http://www.pycon.it">http://www.pycon.it</a>) was a variant of the Python logo,
but with wrong colors.</p>
<p><span class="action">S. Deibel will ask PyCon Italia to correct their usage of the
Python logo.</span></p>
<p>M. von Löwis and D. Goodger both suggested they use the PyCon logo
instead.  D. Goodger noted that he'd rather see them use the PyCon
logo, perhaps with color variation.</p>
<p>S. Deibel asked if we should have a PSF logo, for example to show PSF
support.  D. Goodger replied that he has been meaning to make one.</p>
<p><span class="action">D. Goodger will produce a PSF logo based on the Python logo.</span></p>

sponsorship of PyCon Uno (Italy).</span></p>
<p>D. Goodger noted that a gold sponsorship allows for a banner and comes
with 3 conference passes.  He further noted that we'll need a banner
for EuroPython too, and it can stay in Europe.</p>

<p>Jeff Rush sent email requesting some changes to the python.org home
page.  The Board agreed that we don't need to decide; this is a matter
for the pydotorg maintainers.</p>
<p><span class="action">S. Deibel will refer Jeff Rush to the pydotorg mailing list
for changes to python.org.</span></p>

<p>Jeff Rush updated his accomplishments
(<a class="reference" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/AdvocacyAccomplishments">http://wiki.python.org/moin/AdvocacyAccomplishments</a>) and to-do list
(<a class="reference" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonAdvocacyCoordinator">http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonAdvocacyCoordinator</a>).  M. von Löwis
remarked &quot;the activities listed look right to me&quot;.  T. Peters noted
that the Board should not micromanage; this type of review should be
up to the supervisors (S. Deibel and S. Holden), unless the
supervisors feel it necessary to ask the full Board.</p>
<p>T. Peters questioned the wisdom of the Advocacy Coordinator reviewing
a textbook, which can take a lot of time: &quot;If the goal is to review
its Python content for accuracy, perhaps; if it's to review the
textbook as a whole, no way.&quot;</p>
<p>D. Ascher: &quot;In general, I get the impression that he ends up putting
things on his TODO list that he wants to do, not things we're likely
to think are good ideas.&quot;  T. Peters: &quot;That's my impression too.  And
that's the same thing I'd do if I were him.&quot;</p>

<p>T.&nbsp;Peters:</p>
<blockquote>
As a business, we need a serious written budget.  Long-term goals
live or die by whether a budget can support them.  We tend to
bounce around based on the last thing someone complained about.
Forcing ourselves to write a serious budget would force a serious
debate about long-term goals.</blockquote>
<p>D. Ascher noted that we don't actually spend any real money.
S. Deibel replied that the money going to the Advocacy Coordinator is
fairly substantial over a full year.  K. Kaiser concurred: &quot;it
approximates (or exceeds) our PyCon plus Sponsor income.&quot;</p>
<p>D. Goodger: &quot;We should be spending money.  If we spend it wisely &amp;
well, more should come in.&quot;</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;Ascher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also think that there's a problem in that the board is saying
we'll do what the membership wants and the membership doesn't
really say what they want.</p>
<p>The fact is the PSF has no authority on the language, which is
what people actually care about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D.&nbsp;Goodger:</p>
<blockquote>
I started a &quot;Budget &amp; Action Plan&quot;, but it needs to be fleshed
out.  Would anyone like to help?</blockquote>
<p>(No one stepped forward.)</p>
<p>S. Deibel: &quot;The real issue may be not $ but time and effort no one has
available.&quot;</p>
