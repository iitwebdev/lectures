</ul>
<p>Status: in progress.</p>
<p>S. Deibel mentioned the possibility of a Python.org sprint at
PyCon.  It would require a list of what is needed; Tim Parkin won't
be there and he wasn't sure who else has the knowledge.</p>

<h3><a id="carried-forward" name="carried-forward">3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carried Forward</a></h3>
<p>The following are action items carried forward from the January 2006
meeting, as highlighted in the minutes (Section 3, Status of Past
Action Items):</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Originally from September 2005, Section 4, Donor Levels:
<span class="action">S. Deibel will add the topic of &quot;Donor Levels&quot; to the
agenda of a future meeting, and may begin discussions via email
before that.</span></p>
<p>Status: carried forward.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Originally from September 2005, Section 9, Grants Committee: M. von
Löwis will verify whether Brian Zimmer's grant invoice is the one
previously discussed (i.e. a reduced amount of work, and a reduced
payment).</p>
<p>Status: <strong>done</strong>.</p>
<p>M. von Löwis reported that the committee approved the split, and
Frank Wierzbicki has provided a schedule.  There have been two
contracts, as Frank had last-minute revisions to the schedule; the
treasurer has the latest revision.  A new invoice from Brian Zimmer
is required.  <span class="action">M. von Löwis will ask Brian Zimmer to send
an invoice for the part of the Jython grant that goes to him.</span></p>
</li>

<span class="action">K. Kaiser will send a reserve fund investment proposal to
the PSF-board mailing list.</span></p>
<p>K. Kaiser reported that SunTrust is announcing very attractive new
rates today, around 5%; he hoped to have them before the meeting
but no luck.  There is a long-term manager's special at 5%,
probably for 15 months.  There is no great penalty in the unlikely
event we make an early withdrawl.</p>
<p>K. Kaiser will prepare a proposal and send it to the PSF-board
mailing list before PyCon.  M. von Löwis and K. Kaiser noted that a
resolution was not required (from the October 2005 minutes: “it is
within the power of the Treasurer to make this decision, and that a
formal resolution was not required”).</p>
<p>Status: carried forward.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Originally from November 2005, Section 8, Trademark Policy:
<span class="action">D. Ascher will probably work with ActiveState's legal
person on trademark policy.</span></p>

<span class="action">S. Holden said that he would be responsible for making
sure that documentation is available for the new python.org
system.</span></p>
<p>Status: carried forward.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Originally from December 2005, Section 6, PSF Member Meeting:
J. Hylton took on the task of finding someone to send out member
meeting notices &amp; proxy forms.</p>
<p>Status: <strong>done</strong>.  Notices have been sent.</p>
</li>

member meeting.</span></p>
<p>Status: carried forward.</p>

Stein and ask about their attendance at PyCon and possible BoF
participation.</span></p>
<p>Status: carried forward.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Originally from December 2005, Section 7, PSF BoF Sessions: M. von
Löwis agreed to see if the grant recipients (Greg Wilson, Brian
Zimmer, and/or Ilya Etingof) will be at PyCon, and ask them to
report on what they've done.</p>
<p>Status: <strong>done</strong>.  M. von Löwis reported that all of the grant
recipients were asked, and all said they would be unable to attend
PyCon.</p>
<p>A post to the PSF blog was suggested, and discussion was deferred
to email.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a id="new-in-january" name="new-in-january">3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New in January</a></h3>
<p>The following action items originated with the January 2006 meeting,
as highlighted in the minutes:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Section 3.4, item 5, New in December (PSF Member Meeting): [M. von
Löwis] We should set a deadline for closing the absentee ballot.</p>
<p>Status: <strong>done</strong>.  The absentee ballot was closed on February 14.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="financials" name="financials">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financials</a></h2>
<p>The initial ruling period on the PSF's 501(c)(3) status has ended.  We
have surpassed the 1/3 public support ratio needed.</p>
<p><span class="action">K. Kaiser will ping the sponsor members who have not yet paid
their 2006 PSF sponsor fees.</span></p>
<p>K. Kaiser reported that he has rewritten all the transaction
processing and processed everything to date.  The 2005 books are
reconciled with credit cards and bank statements.  The remaining
things to do are to reclassify the PyCon travel grants and to
reclassify &quot;other income&quot; left over from the last PyCon.</p>
<p>S. Deibel asked if there is a list somewhere of which tax/etc forms we
need to file at what times of year?  K. Kaiser replied that N. Norwitz
wrote such a list, &quot;recurring.txt&quot; in the PSF repository.  There
aren't many: the yearly Federal filing, the DE payment, and the 8734
Support Schedule, &quot;which is a bit of a project&quot;.  Also, K. Kaiser
needs to check if anything is needed for Massachussetts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="use-of-pycon-by-other-conferences" name="use-of-pycon-by-other-conferences">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of &quot;PyCon&quot; by Other Conferences</a></h2>
<p>M. von Löwis proposed that the PSF should register &quot;PyCon&quot; as a
trademark, and then approve it for at most one conference (organizer)
per country.  Discussion was deferred to email.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="adjournment" name="adjournment">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjournment</a></h2>
<p>S.&nbsp;Deibel adjourned the meeting at 19:00 UTC.</p>
