<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1" id="why-does-the-psf-have-members" name="why-does-the-psf-have-members">Why does the PSF have members?</a></h2>
<p>The Python Software Foundation is a membership-based, non-profit
corporation.  Membership is necessary to make the PSF a valid legal
entity so it can hold and protect the Python copyrights and
trademarks.  PSF members have a significant stake in the language and
community, and represent the community to help steer the PSF's
direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2" id="what-membership-classes-are-there" name="what-membership-classes-are-there">What membership classes are there?</a></h2>
<p>There are three classes of Python Software Foundation members:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Nominated members</strong> are individuals or entities who have
demonstrated a commitment to the Python language and community.
The PSF serves to steer the Python language and community, and the
best people to do the steering are the ones with an active stake.
Candidates are nominated and elected by existing members (details
below).</li>
<li><strong>Sponsor members</strong> are like nominated members, except that they
must pay a yearly fee to the PSF.  <a class="reference" href="/psf/sponsorship">Sponsor membership details can
be found here.</a></li>
<li><strong>Emeritus members</strong> are former nominated or sponsor members who no
longer have the right to vote or be counted for purposes of quorum.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3" id="how-does-one-become-a-member-of-the-psf" name="how-does-one-become-a-member-of-the-psf">How does one become a member of the PSF?</a></h2>
<p>There are three steps to becoming a nominated member of the Python
Software Foundation:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Nomination.  A person or entity must be nominated by a current
member of the Python Software Foundation.  A membership nomination
is a form of recognition of a pattern of contributions to the
Python community.  Accepting the nomination confirms the nominee's
intention to continue to promote Python and to contribute further
to the community.</li>
<li>Complete and submit the <a class="reference" href="/psf/forms/application">membership application form</a> at least ten days before the meeting
where elections are held..</li>
<li>Election.  The existing members of the PSF vote (in person or by
proxy) at the Annual Meeting, typically held at PyCon.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sponsor members must, in addition, pay an annual fee (<a class="reference" href="/psf/sponsorship">details here</a>).</p>
<p>In nominating and electing new members, the existing members consider
the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Multiple contributions over a period of time.</li>
<li>Shows interest in the on-going stewardship of the language.</li>
<li>Has taken on some form of responsibility (maintaining a Python
website, writing articles/books, running events, writing
summaries/newsletters, maintaining the language, writing docs,
active involvement with community, marketing Python, fundraising,
etc.).</li>
<li>Active in some Python leadership group (python-dev, the marketing
list, an interest group, or similar)</li>
<li>Has visibility (at least a handful of the current members should
have heard of the person; at least one should know enough to
champion the new member)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4" id="can-i-nominate-myself-to-become-a-psf-member" name="can-i-nominate-myself-to-become-a-psf-member">Can I nominate myself to become a PSF member?</a></h2>
<p>No; new members must be nominated by a current member of the Python
Software Foundation.  But you can ask a current PSF member to nominate
you.  It helps to be active in the Python community!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" id="what-are-the-responsibilities-of-a-psf-member" name="what-are-the-responsibilities-of-a-psf-member">What are the responsibilities of a PSF member?</a></h2>
<p>The minimum commitment is to vote in person or by proxy at annual
Python Software Foundation meetings and to keep the PSF updated with
address changes.</p>
<p>PSF members are encouraged to participate in the decision-making
process to shape the PSF's policies and goals, and to volunteer in
various ways.  Members may take part in discussions at meetings and on
the mailing list, serve on committees (conference, grants,
infrastructure, others), serve on the board of directors, or serve as
an officer.  However, members are not required to participate in these
activities, and membership is not a requirement for participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" id="what-if-a-member-cannot-fulfill-their-responsibilities" name="what-if-a-member-cannot-fulfill-their-responsibilities">What if a member cannot fulfill their responsibilities?</a></h2>
<p>Python Software Foundation members who are not active and can no
longer fulfill their responsibilities to represent the community
should convert their membership to emeritus status.  Emeritus members
do not vote at members' meetings.</p>
<p>A <a class="reference" href="/psf/forms/emeritus/">conversion to emeritus membership</a> form is
available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7" id="how-would-my-being-a-member-benefit-the-psf" name="how-would-my-being-a-member-benefit-the-psf">How would my being a member benefit the PSF?</a></h2>
<p>We need smart people with good ideas about how the Python Software
Foundation can continue to evolve as an organization, and how it can
be most effective as a positive force in the Python community.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" id="there-are-already-many-psf-members-would-the-psf-really-benefit-from-another" name="there-are-already-many-psf-members-would-the-psf-really-benefit-from-another">There are already many PSF members. Would the PSF really benefit from another?</a></h2>
<p>Yes.  We need to keep the Python Software Foundation membership
representative of the currently active contributors to the Python
community.  The community changes over time, and it cannot be
represented by a fixed set of members from previous years.  Every
member brings their own unique background and expertise.  New members
can bring valuable new perspectives, fresh ideas, and enthusiasm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" id="can-i-contribute-without-being-a-psf-member" name="can-i-contribute-without-being-a-psf-member">Can I contribute without being a PSF member?</a></h2>
<p>Yes, certainly!  We welcome all contributions.  You can <a class="reference" href="/psf/donations">donate to the
PSF</a>, <a class="reference" href="/dev">get involved with Python development</a>, and/or <a class="reference" href="/psf/volunteer">volunteer in a number of ways</a>.</p>
