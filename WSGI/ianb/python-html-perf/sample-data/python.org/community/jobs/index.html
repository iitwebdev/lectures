Good interpersonal skills. This means being able to work continuously with other developers and talk sensibly with non-technical staff.</p>

<p><em>Posted 8-Jan-2008</em></p>
<p><strong>Job Description</strong>: We am looking to have a CMS for internal sales
processing built and am very keen to use Python through a web browser.
Previously I was looking at PHP and MySQL but thought the power of
Python combined with the rapid development environment of either Turbo
Gears, Django or Zope would be a better option.</p>
<p><strong>What Python is used for</strong>: The CMS is being designed in flow-chart
format at present and should be completed by end of February. I am
looking for a rough price/time estimate.</p>
<p>Our office uses a central Microsoft Small Business Server but could have
a seperate server with Linux if essential.</p>
<p>Overall framework</p>
<p>We are distributors and importers who sell to trade customers, not retail, and our sales processing is seperate to our accounting system. We have no immediate plans to join the two. We need a system to manage:</p>
<p>Monitoring the various stages of an order to include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sending an order to our supplier (multiple)</li>
<li>Status of the order (3 stages)</li>
<li>Receipt of goods</li>
<li>Goods checked</li>
<li>Dispatching goods</li>
<li>Call logging/notes added to each stage as required</li>
<li>Customer enquires for a specific order</li>
<li>Report generation</li>
</ul>
<p>Repairs System:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Returns received</li>
<li>Items checked and repair form completed (printable pdf required)</li>
<li>Repairs sent for repair receipt</li>
<li>Repair status (3 stages)</li>
<li>Received repairs back from manufacturer (multiple)</li>
<li>Goods Checked</li>
<li>Repaired items returned to customers</li>
<li>Call logging/notes added to each stage as required</li>
<li>Report generation</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible additions needed</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To work with multiple suppliers</li>
<li>Possible simple webshop front end for our sales reps to view item availability</li>
<li>Possible integration with ebay to dump old lines/dead stock</li>
<li>Multiple user access and user rights</li>
<li>Import stock availability list from standard .csv updated weekly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>We have managed this via spreadsheets so far and have been doing so for
3 years. We know the procedures well and once flow-charted/mapped, I

<p>We are the most exciting biotech company in the Inland Northwest!  We started only 4 years ago with 3 employees and have expanded to 57.  We are still growing fast and looking for smart people to keep us going strong and creative.  We’ve got an outstanding software development team that has done a great job creating new ways for us to interact with our clients anywhere in the world and to extract data from our innovative genetic tests.  We have recently developed a new web-based application, Genoglyphix™, which allows our clients to look at the genetic data we generate for them here in Spokane.  Genoglyphix™ uses Django and runs on brand new shiny servers.  We focus on excellence and creativity.  We are defining the way genetic testing, data mining and personalized medicine should mesh together in the future.  If you have a - HTML/CSS/XML/JavaScript background, we should talk. We work with a great multimedia firm in Spokane, so editing and production skills aren't what we're looking for. We want a coder who has a good background in database systems and who has a good grounding in programming fundamentals.  More important than any specific skill set however, is a desire to confront challenges and devise innovative solutions to problems.  Genoglyphix™ transforms our raw data into diagnoses in ways never before possible and the ideal candidate must possess the vision to make this happen.  We need someone with a strong, user-focused understanding of the design and development of fielded data, preferably with Django/Python experience.  You will be helping us expand and further develop Genoglyphix.  Interest in genes and DNA is a plus, not a must.  You will be working with people with outstanding biological and medical skills who can teach you, if you are into it.</p>

<li>Do you enjoy finding creative ways at coaxing Python’s vocabulary?</li>

<p><em>Posted 11-Dec-2007</em></p>
<p><strong>Job Description</strong>: Python Ninja (or Pirate)
Etsy is an online marketplace for buying and selling all things handmade: clothing, music, furniture,
software, jewelry, robots. We launched on June 18, 2005, and ever since then have been empowering our
users to make a living doing what they love most.</p>
<p>We are seeking an experienced dynamic language devotee to join our web development effort. You'll be
using python, javascript and other technologies to whip up innovative web applications in many
challenging and interesting domains: social and community, ecommerce, search, and even software
development.</p>
<p>We're also in the process of redesigning and developing our web stack to allow us to scale into outer space
while still providing a fun and productive programming environment. You'll likely end up working on our
in-house orm, our customized cherrypy environment, jinja templates, django-like form processing library,
lucene integration, twisted-based communications protocol, or our kick-ass high-performance memcached library.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to read through the more detailed requirements listed below to insure that you
are the right person for the job. If so, send an email introducing yourself to <a class="reference" href="mailto:work&#37;&#52;&#48;etsy&#46;com">work<span>&#64;</span>etsy<span>&#46;</span>com</a>, being
sure to include your resume and a response to the challenge at the bottom of this description.</p>
<p>Required:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>5+ years of web development experience</li>
<li>3+ years of writing production-level code with a dynamic language (python, ruby, lisp, smalltalk, OO javascript, etc)</li>
<li>Strong OOP skills</li>
<li>Understanding of dynamic language idioms and patterns</li>
<li>Ability and willingness to pick up other languages and technologies</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Desired:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ability to write python code idiomatically</li>
<li>Lives in New York City</li>
<li>Experience with javascript</li>
<li>Experience with java, postgresql and/or php</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Neat:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Plays guitar hero</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Challenge:
A valid response will be either a solution to the problem below, or a link to some code of which you
are particularly proud.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Problem: In the dynamic language of your choice, write a short program that will:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>define a list of the following user ids 42346, 77290, 729 (you can hardcode these, but it should
still work with more or less ids)</li>
<li>retrieve an xml document related to each user at this url &quot;<a class="reference" href="http://api.etsy.com/feeds/xml_user_details.php?id=">http://api.etsy.com/feeds/xml_user_details.php?id=</a>&quot;</li>
<li>retrieve the data contained in the city element from each xml document</li>
<li>keep a running total of how many users are found in each city</li>
<li>display the total count of users living in each city</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can assume user ids are valid and that the url is available. The output should look something
like:</p>
<p>Charlotte: 1
New York: 2</p>
