<h2><a id="introduction" name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://www.astrazeneca.com/">AstraZeneca</a> is one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies.
With over 54,000 employees world-wide, it provides innovative,
effective medicines designed to fight cancer, provide pain control,
heal infection, and fight diseases of the cardiovascular, central
nervous, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems.</p>
<p>Finding a new drug often takes over a decade and more than $800
million. A big problem early in the process is identifying those
candidates more likely to be good drugs from the vast universe of
possible molecules.</p>
<p>Computational chemists have developed many techniques to predict
molecular properties. These can be used to evaluate the likelihood that
a molecule will be stable in the stomach (for pills that are
swallowed), and that it can travel through the blood stream, cross the
cell membrane, and eventually be broken down and eliminated, all
without being too toxic to the body.</p>
<p>If these computational techniques were good enough there would be no
need to do actual experiments. But today's computer models cannot fully
characterize a molecule's behavior in the body, nor replace the
intuition of a skilled pharmaceutical chemist. Real molecules must
still be tested in the laboratory to see how they react.</p>
<p>To save time and money on laboratory work, experimental chemists use
computational models to narrow the field of good drug candidates, while
also verifying that the candidates to be tested are not simple
variations of each other's basic chemical structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="process-improvements-needed" name="process-improvements-needed">Process Improvements Needed</a></h2>
<p>Much of the work on drug identification actually takes place through
collaboration between many research groups scattered around the world.
As part of this process, experimental chemists send a list of compounds
to the computational chemist, who works on the data set and sends back
the results.</p>
<p>Historically, experimental chemists were forced to rely on
computational chemists and other staff to run computer predictions.
Each prediction technique required running a separate program, some
commercial and others developed in-house by different groups around the
company, and each program had its own set of inputs, options,
configurations, and failure behaviors. An experimental chemist usually
didn't have the training to work with them, which meant that the
computational chemists were forced to take time out of their work on
developing new techniques to run routine models.</p>
<p>In 2000, AstraZeneca wanted to improve this process so that experimental
chemists could make better computational predictions on their own, and
so that the research of the computational chemists could progress at a
faster rate, and make its way into the lab more quickly.</p>
<p>Pierre Bruneau, a Principal Scientist at AstraZeneca, had worked on this
problem while at Zeneca, which merged to form AstraZeneca. He developed a
web-based interface called H2X, named after the allied navigation systems used
during the second world war. H2X was based on an in-house molecular property
calculator called Drone. This system used a Perl script which computed some of
the simpler molecular properties by calling the appropriate prediction
program, usually through a wrapper written in Perl, csh, or a domain specific
control language.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="python-chosen" name="python-chosen">Python Chosen</a></h2>
<p>H2X using Drone was a successful experiment and it was used by many
people. In 2001 AstraZeneca decided to develop it further and brought
in Andrew Dalke as a consultant, to improve the back-end code by making
it more robust, extensible, and maintainable. Andrew, a well-known
advocate for Python in computational chemistry and biology, convinced
the group that Python was the appropriate language for the next
generation back-end, which was named PyDrone.</p>
<p>Python was chosen for this work because it is one of the best languages
available for physical scientists, that is, for people who do not have
a computer science background. Many other powerful and expressive high
level languages exist, including Perl, Lisp, Scheme, Ruby, CAML, and
Haskell. Of all these, Python is one of the few that is based on
research into usability and the factors that make a programming
language easy to learn and use. Yet Python was also designed to solve
real-world problems faced by an expert programmer. The result is a
language that scales well from small scripts written by a chemist to
large packages written by a software developer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="python-s-error-handling-improves-robustness" name="python-s-error-handling-improves-robustness">Python's Error Handling Improves Robustness</a></h2>
<p>The first iteration of PyDrone refactored the existing Perl code into
more appropriate functions, classes, and modules while translating the
code base into Python. Refactoring the Perl code without moving to
Python would have produced comparable architectural results, but
Python's explicit error handling and stronger type checking helped
to considerably improve the code's robustness.</p>
<p>The current version of PyDrone uses about 20 different external
binaries and scripts to predict various molecular properties. When an
external program works correctly, then the output is easy to parse into
the desired results. However, these programs don't always work
correctly, are not fully documented, and it's often hard to determine
all the possible failure cases from the outside. To compensate for
this, the PyDrone developers wrote tests to anticipate as many error
cases as possible, but it was impossible to rule out additional
unexpected error cases after deployment.</p>
<p>From experience dealing with this issue first in Perl (Drone) and then
in Python (PyDrone), we found that Python is better at catching many
types of errors and at managing unexpected problems in a deployed
application. This is a result of the way in which the two languages
approach error handling in general. For example, Perl's I/O routines
are quiet and failures must be checked explicitly, usually with the &quot;or
die&quot; idiom. A conscientious programmer will always add those, but they
take up space, are easy to forget, and hard to test. In contrast to
this, Python functions are noisy and almost always raise an exception
automatically when there is a problem in code.</p>
<p>After rewriting in Python, we initially thought this noisy behavior was
a nuisance because Python kept raising exceptions and stopping where the
old Perl code had kept on going. However, we soon found that nearly
every exception indicated a previously undetected error case for which
we needed to add new error handling code. Python was helping us find
problem spots and preventing us from letting silent errors into our
data.</p>
<p>One example of an error case that Python uncovered for us was caused by
an external prediction program that would usually return a numerical
error code but in some cases was found to return the string &quot;error&quot;
instead. In Perl, strings and numbers are converted automatically, for
example the string <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;123&quot;</span></tt> becomes the integer <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">123</span></tt>. Unfortunately, Perl
also converts non-numerical strings, such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;error&quot;</span></tt>, to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span></tt>. As a result
of this, Drone was treating &quot;error&quot; as a successful return value,
leading to incorrect results. Python's stronger typing uncovered the
error as soon as the rare case that caused it was executed.</p>
<p>Another way in which Python helped us to improve our code was by its
inclusion of a complete stack traceback with each exception report. We
found this very useful in helping us understand the source of a problem
without needing to run a debugger or add extra code instrumentation.
This feature of Python was particularly helpful in remote debugging of
rare cases. Andrew is in the United States and Pierre is in France.
When an error occurred, Pierre's email with the traceback often
contained enough information to pinpoint and fix the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="adding-powerful-extensibility-with-python" name="adding-powerful-extensibility-with-python">Adding Powerful Extensibility with Python</a></h2>
<p>The next stage in PyDrone's development was to improve its
extensibility. Some molecular properties depend on other properties.
For example, a molecule's mass depends on its composition. The older
Drone code maintained these dependencies manually with a set of 'if'
statements that specified which prediction routines should be called,
and in which order, during execution of an analysis. In this approach,
adding new dependencies soon led to a combinatorial nightmare.</p>
<p>To solve this problem in Python, we developed a simple rule base which
acts like a Python dictionary. It contains a data cache and a mapping
from property name to prediction function. If a requested property name
(the dictionary key) is in the cache, we reuse it. Otherwise, we find
the associated function, call it to compute the value, store the result
in the cache, and return it. The functions themselves are given a
reference to the Properties manager so they can recursively request any
additionally needed dependencies. To add a new prediction we register
the new function in the function table -- and let the functions
themselves handle the dependencies. The cache is needed because some
properties are expensive to compute or are needed by many other
properties.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Architecture of the Property Manager" src="/files/success/astra/property_manager_web.gif" />
</div>
<p><em>Architecture of the Property Manager</em> <a class="reference" href="/files/success/astra/property_manager.jpg">Zoom in</a></p>
<p>The resulting new architecture made a simple but profound difference to
the project. We now have a single system that can accommodate all
current and future prediction methods, that computes only the minimum
needed to yield the requested results, and that is easy to understand
and maintain. Before we built it in Python, several people in the
company had argued it impossible to build such a system at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="the-benefits-of-python-s-type-system" name="the-benefits-of-python-s-type-system">The Benefits of Python's Type System</a></h2>
<p>The PyDrone architecture could have been implemented in many languages,
but Python's dynamic typing made it much easier to build our Property
manager. Some molecular properties are numbers, others strings, or
lists and dictionaries, and still others are class instances. A
statically typed language would have required extra hassle to allow a
mixture of return types to be inserted into the Property manager. Even
Perl, which is also dynamically typed, would have required some way to
distinguish between references to a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$scalar</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%hash</span></tt>, or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;list</span></tt>. In Python
it just worked, and we could mix the data types of the keys in the
Property manager dictionary without any extra effort at all. Yet, as
described above, Python does at the same time provide sufficient data
type checking to find many kinds of common type mismatch errors.</p>
<p>One of the factors that made our Property manager so successful was
that Python lets user-defined types emulate the behavior of built-in
types. Our Property manager acts very much like a lookup table that
maps property name to value, so we designed it to emulate a Python
dictionary. In Python, this is done by implementing specific special
methods such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__getitem__()</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__setitem__()</span></tt>, and so forth. By
emulating a dictionary, nearly every other Python function that
operates on a dictionary would work with our manager. It also made the
code easier to understand and debug because the syntax and
point-of-call usage fit naturally with what people expect.</p>
<p>Python facilitated our Property manager implementation in other ways as
well. One PyDrone feature that had been requested by users was the
ability to describe a new prediction using an equation based on
existing properties. For example, an equation might look like:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0.34</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">(0.78*CLOGP)</span> <span class="pre">-</span></tt> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(0.018*HBA)</span> <span class="pre">-</span></tt> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(0.015*HB_TOT)</span> <span class="pre">-</span></tt>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(0.11*MM_HADCA)</span> <span class="pre">-</span></tt> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(0.017*MM_QON)</span> <span class="pre">+</span></tt> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(0.012*VDW_POL_AREA)</span></tt></p>
<p>where the variables are keys in the Property manager. This was quite
easy to implement in Python, and we would be hard pressed to find a
language that makes it any easier. Python's mathematical expressions
are almost identical to the standard form used in the sciences, so we
could use Python's &quot;eval&quot; statement to parse and evaluate the
user-defined expressions. Because our Property manager acts like a
Python dictionary, it could (at least in theory) be provided directly
to the eval statement as the locals dictionary used for variable lookup
during expression evaluation.</p>
<p>As it turned out, for performance reasons, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval()</span></tt> implementation in
Python accepts only built-in dictionary types and not an emulated
mapping type, so we had to engage in some extra trickery to make our
on-demand dependency system work with equations. Nevertheless, the
entire implementation was quite easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="results" name="results">Results</a></h2>
<p>PyDrone took about 3 months of development time, another 3 months of
QA, and 3 weeks of documentation time to produce about 5,600 lines of
finished Python code.</p>
<p>Overall PyDrone has been a wonderful success for AstraZeneca. As a
result of using Python, we were able to quickly and easily develop a
great tool that is both very simple to use and that adapts well to new
prediction methods.</p>
<p>The biggest problem we've had with Python is that relatively few people
at AstraZeneca use it for development. The IT group prefers either Perl
(systems people) or Java (architecture people) so we occasionally get
requests to rewrite parts of the project in one of those languages.
Even so, we have found developers are interested in learning Python,
especially when they see comparisons of development time and effort,
resulting code size, and other metrics.</p>
