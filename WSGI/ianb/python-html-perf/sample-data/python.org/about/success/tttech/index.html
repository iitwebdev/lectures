<h2><a id="introduction" name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://www.tttech.com/">TTTech</a>, founded in 1998, focuses on developing a technology for
safety-critical real-time systems.  Our central technology is the
Time-Triggered Protocol (TTP), a communication protocol used in embedded
systems for distributed fault-tolerant applications, such as drive-by-wire
and fly-by-wire vehicles.  For TTP, we provide chip models for implementing
the necessary hardware in silicon, services to customers using the
technology, and a broad range of tools.</p>
<p>When starting out in 1998, we urgently needed tools for configuring
TTP-based networks.  Several people in the team already had experience in
writing configuration tools for embedded systems, mostly in C and C++.
Based on those experiences, it was clear that we needed some way to speed up
development.  One of the requirements was platform independence, our target
platforms being all different Windows platforms and optionally Linux.  The
configuration tools had to be scriptable, in order to interface easily with
other tools used by our customers.</p>
<p>These requirements suggested the use of a scripting language able to support
a cross-platform GUI toolkit.  A prototype of the user interface was built
with Python and Tkinter over a weekend. The quick result dispelled
top-management doubts, and the project was started with Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="implementation" name="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Within three months, an initial team of two people (one person working
full-time, one part-time) was able to develop and release the first
version of our TTP network configuration tool, TTP-Plan. We had
anticipated that parts of the program, notably the scheduler, would
have to be recoded as Python extensions in C after the first
prototype's completion. In fact, however, TTP-Plan is still coded in
pure Python, yet our customers appreciate it for its excellent
performance.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Figure A" src="/files/success/tttech/o_model-web.jpg" />
</div>
<p><em>Figure A: The TTT-Plan Pilot allows users to manipulate object data and
links between objects</em> <a class="reference" href="/files/success/tttech/o_model.png">Zoom in</a></p>
<p>For the first tool, TTP-Plan, we created a framework in Python that let us
apply Python's introspection features in order to reuse, for several
different purposes, the information already present in the code.</p>
<p>For example, the help texts present in the tool are reused to produce the
reference section in the written documentation.  The object model of the
configuration tool is visible to the user, displayed in a &quot;Pilot-Window&quot;.
The Pilot lets the user manipulate object data, and links between objects,
by clicking on the respective item (see Figure A).  This click opens an
object editor for modification of attributes.  The object editor is
parameterized with the type of object in the model.  The code for drawing
the object model, for the object editor, and for extracting the help
information, is all part of the framework, and can be reused by other tools
in the TTP-Tools family.  This framework was of great help when building the
node configuration tool TTP-Build, which uses a network configuration
generated by TTP-Plan to produce the configuration of an individual node in
the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="productivity-of-programmers-using-the-framework" name="productivity-of-programmers-using-the-framework">Productivity of Programmers Using the Framework</a></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, new tools were built using the existing framework.  A programmer
new to both Python and our framework was able to build a new configuration
tool for the LIN protocol, a product that is now called LIN-Plan, within
three months.  The tool was initially built for a first-time customer and is
now generally available.  It will soon see its second release.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="tools-not-written-in-python" name="tools-not-written-in-python">Tools not Written in Python</a></h2>
<p>The good experiences with the Python-based tools are confirmed by other
projects originally coded in C++.  The development of TTP-Load, the download
tool, started in 1999.  We decided to write this tool in C++ because the
tool had to use a low-level Ethernet driver in order to communicate with an
Ethernet-to-TTP gateway, called a monitoring node.  The protocol for
communicating with the monitoring node at the time used raw Ethernet frames.</p>
<p>The year 2001 saw two major changes.  A new TTP controller was introduced,
and we faced a redesign of TTP-Load because the download protocol of the
chip had changed, and support of different download targets was difficult.
Communication over raw Ethernet to the monitoring node used a
hard-to-maintain driver that needed constant adaptation to new Windows
versions.  Instead of porting the driver to new Windows versions -- at that
time Windows NT was supported but we had urgent requests for Windows 2000
and XP was already visible on the horizon -- we decided to use standard
internet protocols (UDP for the old monitoring node and TCP for the new one)
for communication.  For TTP-Load, which does not have performance
requirements for the user interface, it was decided to rewrite the tool from
scratch, entirely in Python.  This was done by one person not familiar with
the framework within six weeks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="conclusion" name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>In our experience, programming productivity is substantially higher with
Python than with C++.  This is substantiated in detail in a paper presented at
OSCON 1999 by one of our developers <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id3" name="id3">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Today, five people are involved with the daily development of our
Python-coded tools.  Relying on our Python framework, we are able to quickly
implement new features, and to adapt the tools to newly available hardware
on short notice.</p>
<p>To summarize, with Python we were able to produce a mission-critical set of
software products -- success of TTP as a communication protocol depends on
the availability of high-quality configuration tools -- within a short time
frame.  The code is very easy to maintain, and recoding in Python a whole
medium-sized project proved an easy task too.  Overall, using Python has led
to a successful product line with an ever-growing number of satisfied
customers.</p>

<p>Ralf Schlatterbeck Ph.D. specialises in tool support for embedded and
real-time systems. He has written a number of development tools for
real-time programmers.  Ralf joined TTTech in 2000, after the tools
described in this story had already been written, and is now responsible
for their further development and maintenance.</p>
