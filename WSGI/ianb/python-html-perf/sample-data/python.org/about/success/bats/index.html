<h2><a id="introduction" name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Blind Audio Tactile Mapping System (BATS) seeks to provide access
to maps for the blind and visually impaired. Our goal is to devise ways
to present traditionally visual information to the user's other senses.
The need for this project became clear when Jason Morris came to the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to study Classics. Morris
works at the Ancient World Mapping Center (AWMC), a foundation to
advance the field of ancient studies with the use of cartography and
geographic information science. Morris, who has been blind since an
early age, has faced the denial of access to information critical to
his choice of study for the majority of his life. With his work at the
AWMC he vowed to create a solution.</p>
<p>Morris' chance meeting with Gary Bishop, Associate Professor of
Computer Science, set the project in motion. Bishop had been seeking
users who could benefit from the development of assistive tools
customized for their needs. At the time of their meeting, there were no
maps of the ancient world in a format accessible to the visually
impaired. After their initial conversation, Dr. Bishop created the
opportunity for a team of undergraduate students to implement a
solution in a semester-long software engineering course. We were
fortunate to be part of the five-person team assembled to work on this
exciting project.</p>
<p>The goal of the software engineering course, taught by Associate
Professor Kye Hedlund, was to teach students about working
collaboratively, identifying goals, and meeting deadlines. Our team
began by meeting with our three advisors to talk about initial design
decisions. Professor Bishop presented us with Dr. Dan Jacobson's paper
<em>Navigating maps with little or no sight: An audio-tactile approach</em> as
a basis for developing a tool that provided access to spatial
information through sound and touch. The core components of our system
were a Pentium III computer running Windows 2000, a touch pad as the
primary input device, and the Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 to communicate
information with a synthesized voice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="choice-of-python" name="choice-of-python">Choice of Python</a></h2>
<p>Faced with the daunting task of coding a program with little precedent,
the first major design decision our team had to tackle was the choice
of a programming language. Our initial thoughts were to use either C++
or Java since everyone in the group was proficient with both. One group
member had been exposed to Python in an earlier class and was impressed
with the power and ease of use it provided. The fact that the other
four members had no experience with the language fortunately did not
stop us from making the wise decision to use Python.</p>
<p>Very early in the development we required a simple program to test how
the touch pad interacts with the operating system. This proved
incredibly easy with <a class="reference" href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>, a Python wrapper for the powerful
wxWindows GUI toolkit. Setting up a frame to take full control of the
screen was very straightforward and required minimal coding.</p>
<p>Given our strict time constraints, a language that allowed for rapid
development such as this was a great advantage. No one in the group at
that time had any real concept of the extent to which we would be able
to use Python in the project. However, as we discovered the extensive
collection of libraries and modules available for it, we decided that
Python could be used exclusively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="implementation" name="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Our next meetings were with Tom Elliott, the Director of the Ancient
World Mapping Center, who conveniently holds an undergraduate degree in
Computer Science. He introduced us to the Barrington Atlas, a twelve
year undertaking that culminated with the first comprehensive maps of
ancient Greek and Roman civilizations to be produced since 1874. The
Ancient World Mapping Center is now digitizing all the information
contained in this atlas, making the information held within it into an
even richer educational tool. The British Isles were selected as the
prototype map. Our discussions centered on translating the visual
representation of the image and its underlying database information
into a format our program could use.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="BATS Test Map" src="/files/success/bats/tact3image-web.jpg" />
</div>
<p><em>Test map for the BATs system</em> <a class="reference" href="/files/success/bats/tact3image.jpg">Zoom in</a></p>
<p>Elliott provided the first two data files for BATS using ArcView, a
powerful tool for working with maps. Two ASCII text files were
produced, indicating the surface type and elevation of our map. The
information had been formatted as a grid of 1024 columns and 768 rows
to match the resolution of our display and touch pad. We decided to
read this grid of numbers into Numeric arrays in Python.</p>
<p>Originally quite a bit of preprocessing was involved to scale down the
data to fit our internal model. We did not want to go through the
reading and scaling process every time the program was launched because
it was quite time consuming. Instead we were able to read and scale the
data once, then Pickle the internal structure to a compressed file. Now
the program had only to decompress the data and load it directly into
the appropriate data structure, resulting in a significant reduction in
startup time.</p>
<p>The loaded grid enabled a one-to-one correspondence between a pixel in
our image and a value in the text file. We envisioned that the user
would receive constant feedback through the audio device about their
current location on the map by associating sounds with surface types.
Our next concern was whether Python could retrieve the information from
the data structure fast enough to provide responsive feedback to our
end user. Python was however able to execute these operations smoothly
and enabled us to give immediate aural feedback about the surface type.
Watching the user's cursor on the screen we saw that upon entering the
ocean area, the program's sound output was immediately switched to the
sounds of waves, and when re-entering land the sound switched again without
delay. The user had begun his first digital exploration of the shape of
the land of the British Isles. Elevation could also be read for every
point in the map without any computational pauses.</p>
<p>Our system consists of two major components, a graphical user interface
and a data manager.  The user interface interacts with the data through
the data manager.  Our interface uses only a touch pad and a number
keypad to assist visually impaired people with minimal computer
experience. As the user moves around the touch pad the wxPython Mouse
Motion Event triggers a query of the surface type table and the city
database.  Python allowed us to quickly reassign and test combinations
of key and mouse events.</p>
<p>The user interface involves the touch pad, the number keypad, and a
voice synthesizer to provide feedback. The mouse and key events were
handled by wxPython, but we also needed to call Microsoft's Speech
API. We did this using Mark Hammond's <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/windows/win32com/">win32com</a> module, which allowed us
to create a voice and produce speech in only three lines of code.</p>
<p>The data manager maintains the data in three Numeric arrays and an ODBC
database connection created using the <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/windows/win32all/">win32all</a> package. The three
arrays are used to store the altitude, land type, and a database key
value. The decision to query the Microsoft Access database directly
from BATS was made very close to our project deadline. Again Python
enabled our team to implement the idea quickly and successfully.
Queries to the Access database are done through an ODBC connection
using the value from the database key array to determine what city
information is associated with a given location. The ability to run
queries on the database greatly extended the educational value of this
tool by allowing for the dynamic creation of maps.</p>

<h2><a id="results" name="results">Results</a></h2>
<p>At the completion of our semester we had created a tool that allowed
exploration of complex map information.  All of the information that
could have been gained by looking at the map could now be gained in a
similar way through listening to a synthesized voice and sound icons.
Our map also provided for the immediate communication of distances
between any two locations without having to rely on a table for
calculations.  The ability to hear the periods of existence, type and
name of settlements extended the use of the map beyond what is
available in a strictly visual rendering.  Morris was able to use our
project as a resource in writing a graduate level paper for the
Classics Department.</p>

<p>Python allowed us to prove that this type of data manipulation for maps
is possible and allowed us to create a powerful demonstration to get
others excited about the project. We had the opportunity to demo our
software during presentations throughout the course of the semester.
During our preparations just prior to a presentation, a previously
unnoticed bug would invariably appear. We found that these bugs could
be located and resolved very quickly with Python, which reports the
line number and stack trace to the point where the error occurred.
There is no need to compile code or set up complex links between
libraries. Since everything is interpreted at runtime, we were able to
continue rapid development without being bogged down by complex
syntactic problems or slowed by compile times.</p>
<p>The ability to quickly tailor a demonstration for a particular audience
was also an advantage of Python. When presenting our project to a group
of orientation and mobility instructors and their visually impaired
students we were able to quickly create a map of North Carolina that
would be more familiar than that of Ancient England. Once we had an
understanding of how all the pieces should fit together, Python
provided an environment to stitch the program together easily. The
demos we were able to produce helped us secure a Microsoft Research
grant to further the project. These demonstrations have also attracted
the interest of the media, which is helping to publicize the need for
maps for the blind.</p>
<p>Python also made it very easy to integrate other programmers' modules
into our code. We have and are continuing to experiment with the <a class="reference" href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python
Imaging Library</a>, <a class="reference" href="http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/">pyXML</a>, and <a class="reference" href="http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy/">Numeric</a>. Professor Bishop and graduate
student Peter Parente enabled use of the <a class="reference" href="http://www.openal.org/">OpenAL</a> library for spatial
sound and the <a class="reference" href="http://www.immersion.com/">Immersion</a> library for haptic feedback from Python. This
was done with <a class="reference" href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>, which allows for the automated development of
Python language bindings for C and C++ code.</p>
<p>The BATS team is now working on taking aspects of the program to local
high schools. We believe that it will be easy to illustrate the
concepts of accessible design through Python's easy to read code. We
hope to get many students excited about the possibilities of assistive
technology and to foster a community of people working on open-source
solutions. If you would like to become involved please check the
