<h2><a id="introduction" name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://www.eztrip.com/">EZTrip.com</a> is an online travel reservation company based in the United
States. Our core business is developing online booking engines and related
systems that communicate with large global distribution systems (GDS), as well
as directly to suppliers' central reservation systems (CRS).</p>
<p>Most GDS's were built in the late 1960's and early 1970's and are mainframe
based OLAP systems that handle millions of transactions per day. GDS's work
incredibly well and are testament to the skill of the early developers that
built them, but they have severe limitations when it comes to the data that
can be entered into them, and the formats that the data is allowed to take.
Although some CRS's used by individual suppliers are more modern, they inherit
many of the limitations of the GDS's as a result of their tight data-level
integration with them.</p>
<p>This is a problem when using these systems in the context of a web-based
applications like EZTrip.com. Also, GDS's are not relational systems and lack
a query language like SQL, so queries are limited by the API provided by its
developers.</p>
<p>During the past 2 years our online processing systems have been developed in
Java because many of the GDS's provide a low level Java or C API, and most of
our developers have experience building J2EE applications. While Java is a
great language for building a large web presence with persistent data, many
aspects of our development would quickly become unmanageable and prohibitively
expensive using Java alone. Python and <a class="reference" href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> are used instead for many of
the day to day integration tasks and the large amount of data &quot;cleaning&quot; that
are required to provide customers with a user-friendly interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="green-screens" name="green-screens">Green Screens</a></h2>
<p>The travel industry is much like the financial industry in that &quot;screen
scraping&quot; is often required to integrate older systems that provide no
interface other than the textual screen interface used by its original human
users.</p>
<p>Screen scraping makes heavy use of text processing tools, regular expressions,
and string manipulation, all of which are built into Python and are very easy
to work with. Python also provides the ability to communicate easily with
other operating system processes, which made it possible to leverage external
tools like <strong>sed</strong> and <strong>awk</strong> for the processing tasks  This flexibility in
choosing the right tool for the job was critical to the rapid development
of the custom screen scrapers needed to interface to the very many unique
travel supplier's systems.</p>
<p>EZTrip.com uses Python's OO aspects heavily and has built an extensive class
library that allows new developers to come up to speed quickly when working on
new GDS data access tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="text-text-text" name="text-text-text">Text, Text, Text</a></h2>
<p>Text processing is where Python really shines for us. Almost all the data handled at
EZTrip.com is text-based.  From screen scraping GDS data to data mining
vendors' websites, Python tools munge text day in and day out, and have
yet to run into any problems with the language or it's performance. For these
tasks, <em>Python is fast</em>.</p>
<p>One of the tools currently being worked on is a localization system that
allows generation of localized versions of hotel property descriptions without
requiring human translators for every one of the 100,000 hotels in the
EZTrip.com network. This tool will increase market size 10 fold, and is a
project that is coming along much faster than anticipated.  Python's text
processing capabilities helped make it possible to build a solution
with much higher productivity per man hour than would have been possible
using Java as the development language.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="web-services-to-the-rescue" name="web-services-to-the-rescue">Web Services To The Rescue</a></h2>
<p>In the past year or so, the larger suppliers have been slowly rolling out Web
services for some of their products and services. These also work seamlessly
with our Python code. The XML processing tools in Python are, like everything
else included with Python, well thought out, spec compliant, and powerful.</p>
<p>EZTrip.com often builds automated test suites in Python, in order to validate
a new supplier Web service before rolling it into its web presence. Python's
rapid development times and capacity for automating this kind of testing makes
it possible to quickly find and work around bugs in the supplier's code,
resulting in a more a robust web application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="why-python" name="why-python">Why Python?</a></h2>
<p>The author originally came across Python in 1999 while working on a large
Java-based website. Like many developers new to Python, the use of indentation
to indicate program structure was a stumbling block during this initial
contact and Python was not adopted for use with that project. On second look,
after actual experience with the language, the language's indentation-defined
structure became a virtue, an important part of the overall power and
simplicity of the language.</p>
<p>In addition to Python's clean design, the following factors make Python
a good choice for enterprise integration tasks, like those undertaken
at EZTrip.com:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>OS Independence</strong> - The ability to develop code on one operating system,
email it to a travel suppliers IT group, and have it work seamlessly on another
operating system has been a godsend in deploying and maintaining the many
components of EZTrip.com.</li>
<li><strong>Database Integration</strong> - Python's database tools are top notch, allowing for
quick and painless development of data mining tools in a matter of hours, rather
than the days or weeks it would take in a language like Java.</li>
<li><strong>Batteries Included</strong> - Except for a few database libraries and domain-specific
libraries developed in-house, almost everything needed by EZTrip.com developers
is included in the Python distribution.  Nevertheless, Python has managed to avoid
the bloat seen in many other languages.</li>
<li><strong>Community</strong> - The Python community is fantastic. The amount of online technical
information available for Python is vast. A good internet search engine will
almost always find the answers a developer needs, any time of the day
or night. In those cases where EZTrip.com developers have had questions not
answered by a web search, for example about the LDAP library or a database library,
the developers of those projects have always been willing to provide an answer
quickly.  This has been invaluable as a time saver, and in keeping development
costs down.</li>
<li><strong>Jython</strong> - Jython is an implementation of Python that is written in Java and runs
on the Java Virtual Machine.  It provides a powerful tool for scripting Java,
and a more productive way to develop components for use in a Java system.
For EZTrip.com, Jython has bridged the gap between the front-end Java-based web
systems and the back-end Python tools that do much of the heavy lifting.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="newbies" name="newbies">Newbies</a></h2>
<p>One unexpected bonus discovered in the short 2 years EZTrip.com has been using
Python is its support for new developers and interns, and its ability to make
existing code more approachable and maintainable. Python has exhibited an
uncanny ability to teach and encourage good coding skills, enabling developers
to write clear and concise code. Python is very well designed, and this
quality tends to transfer into the software that is written with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="summary" name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Python has helped <a class="reference" href="http://www.eztrip.com/">EZTrip.com</a> in countless ways. It has reduced costs by
speeding development time, improved integration with myriad suppliers,
provided a solid backbone to the behind-the-scenes development that continues
to strengthen EZTrip.com, and made it possible to meet the many goals faced as
the business has grown. Without Python, EZTrip.com would not be as successful
in the online travel space as it has been in such a short period of time.</p>
