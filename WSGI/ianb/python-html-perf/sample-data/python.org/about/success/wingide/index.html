<h2><a id="introduction" name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://wingide.com/">Wing IDE</a> is a commercial integrated development environment for the Python
programming language. Wing provides developers with a full-featured source
editor, debugger, code browser, and many other tools specifically designed for
use with Python. Wing works with all forms of Python, whether running as a
stand-alone app, under a web server, or in a custom embedded scripting
environment. Several GUI layers (<a class="reference" href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>, <a class="reference" href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/">PyQt</a>, <a class="reference" href="http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk/">PyGTK</a>, and <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter/">Tkinter</a>) are
supported, as are <a class="reference" href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a> and <a class="reference" href="http://www.modpython.org/">mod_python</a> for web development, and <a class="reference" href="http://www.pygame.org/">pygame</a> for game
development.</p>
<p>Wing was inspired in 1999 by several experiences we, its developers, had using
Python alongside other technologies. At that time, we were working as
consultants charged with evaluating a number of alternatives for tiered web
development. Some of these were based on Java and some on Visual Basic, MTS,
and ASP. Concurrently, we happened to be using Python to prototype some of the
functional requirements for the web-deployed business applications we were
developing.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before we found ourselves comparing our Python prototypes
favorably to the actual systems we were developing. Python was a much more
productive way to work, and it seemed to result in at least as good an end
product.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our client never seriously considered Python simply because it
wasn't a mainstream (namely Java or Microsoft) technology. But it was clear to
us that Python could have been a significant cost saver and competitive
advantage for them, and we saw a business opportunity in helping other
organizations benefit by using Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="development-approach" name="development-approach">Development Approach</a></h2>
<p>Work on Wing IDE started almost right away, in mid 1999, initially on a
part-time basis. We realized that writing an entire IDE wasn't going to be
easy and wanted to be sure that Python was really as good as it appeared to us
at the time. The logical way to approach this was to develop the IDE itself in
Python. This would give us proof of concept and let us become early users as
we started to develop and debug Wing IDE with itself.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Screen Shot of Wing IDE 1.1.7 Debugging Itself" src="/files/success/wingide/wingide_web.gif" />
<p class="caption"><em>Wing IDE 1.1.7 in action, debugging itself</em> <a class="reference" href="/files/success/wingide/wingide.png">Zoom in</a></p>
</div>
<p>To speed development and keep costs down, we chose to base Wing on as many
open source modules as we could find. The GUI was written with GTK, which is
accessed from Python via <a class="reference" href="http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk/">PyGTK</a>. The source editor is based on <a class="reference" href="http://www.scintilla.org/">Scintilla</a>, an
open source code editor component. And printing is implemented via py2pdf from
<a class="reference" href="http://www.reportlab.com/">ReportLab</a>.</p>
<p>Initial development was on Linux but we planned to support at least Windows
and eventually other Unix-like operating systems. For this reason, we avoided
platform-specific implementations and chose cross-platform technologies.</p>
<p>Additional development tools used in the project included gcc, Gnu make,
latex, pdflatex, latex2html, emacs/xemacs (before Wing was functional), Visual
C++ 6, and cygwin.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="results" name="results">Results</a></h2>
<p>Our work on Wing IDE has been quite a success. We were able to develop faster
than we originally expected, and to deliver Wing IDE on Linux, Windows 98
through XP, Mac OS X with XDarwin, Solaris, and FreeBSD without major
platform-specific development work. Today, our product is receiving good
reviews and is selling well. All of this has been possible without any outside
funding and with a development team of just two people.</p>
<p>The biggest benefits of using Python have been in overall productivity,
cross-platform deployment, speed of the resulting application, scalability,
rock-solid stability, and its strong support for mixed-language development.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a id="productivity" name="productivity">Productivity</a></h3>
<p>Over the course of this project, we have been able to write on average over
175 lines of debugged, documented, tested code per developer per day. Over a
period of 660 FTE days, we produced a total of approximately 121K lines, of
which 77K were written in Python. Even without considering that a line of
Python is typically equivalent to 10 or more lines of C, we were extremely
pleased with this result.</p>
<p>The entire product, including third party open source modules, actually
contains on the order of 1.2 million lines of code, of which 274K lines are
Python.</p>
<p>So why was using Python so productive, even when only 63% of the code we wrote
was in Python? There is no single answer to this question, but several:</p>
<p><strong>1) Simple syntax</strong> -- Although use of indentation to indicate program structure
sometimes turns off first-time Python users, the reduced typing burden that
comes with avoiding {}'s and similar syntactic sugar does matter over the
course of writing and rewriting hundreds of thousands of lines of code.</p>
<p><strong>2) Dynamic high-level data typing</strong> -- Lack of strong data typing, another
commonly cited &quot;weakness&quot; in Python, is in practice a significant advantage
for most kinds of software development. The bottom line is that you don't need
strong data typing in the context of a language like Python. Common coding
errors are caught anyway by the type system: You still can't add a number to a
string, reference past the end of an array, or call an non-existent class
method. Dynamic high-level data typing cuts out great volumes of support code
and makes it possible to write flexible and introspective code (more on this
below).</p>
<p><strong>3) Powerful, easy-to-use data structures</strong> -- Python's built-in list and
dictionary data structures can be used in combination to build just about any
fast runtime data structure in a snap. This further reduces the amount of
support code you need to write.</p>
<p><strong>4) Extensive standard library</strong> -- Python comes with a vast standard library
supporting everything from string and regular expression processing to XML
parsing and generation, Web services tools, and internet protocol support.
Many common programming tasks have already been built into the standard
library, making it possible to do more with less code. Third-party modules are
also available for database access, CORBA, COM, statistics, math, image
processing, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>5) Introspection</strong> -- Python's flexible data typing system extends also to code
documentation, classes, methods, and even the way in which methods are called.
Python makes introspection extremely accessible to the programmer and,
remarkably, introspective code remains readable and maintainable. This can be
very useful in redirecting I/O to classes of your own design, writing a tracer
that determines code coverage, packing up data to store on disk or send over
the network, developing glue code, writing table-driven algorithms, extracting
documentation from code at runtime, applying design-by-contract development
methods, and in building various types of meta-classes. For almost every
programming task, Python makes it not only possible but quite easy to build
meta-code where one might otherwise end up building gobs of manually crafted
code.</p>
<p><strong>6) Faster development and deeper prototyping</strong> -- Python increases speed of
development to the point where prototyping can be integrated into and
interleaved with the primary development process. When it takes only half a
day to try out a new approach to a problem, rather than the week it might take
in C or C++, programmers are more often empowered to rework existing imperfect
code, and to try out new ideas. This results in the more rapid incorporation
of experience into an application's design, and leads to higher code quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a id="cross-platform-deployment" name="cross-platform-deployment">Cross-platform Deployment</a></h3>
<p>Wing IDE runs on a variety of Posix operating systems and Windows. Throughout
our development process, we've been very happy with the way that Python
performed across platforms. The same Python source or compiled Python byte
code files can be shipped to clients regardless of target platform, making
support quite easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a id="speed-scalability-and-stability" name="speed-scalability-and-stability">Speed, Scalability, and Stability</a></h3>
<p>When we started to write in Python, our previous experience in compiled
languages led us to believe that we would be spending a fair amount of time
either optimizing code or converting it into C or C++ once we had prototyped
it. As it turned out, most of the time Python produced a snappy end product
that didn't require any extra work.</p>
<p>This happened partially because most Python code is really just a thin
interpreted layer over functionality that is written in C or C++. In
our case, this included not just Python's fast built-in data structures and
standard libraries but also the bulk of the GTK GUI development layer and the
Scintilla source editor.</p>
<p>In the course of development and in responding to thousands of support tickets
over a three year period, we have never run into any significant problems with
Python itself, either in scalability or stability. Wing IDE can handle
software projects with thousands of Python files, and in many cases can run
for weeks without problems. To our knowledge, we have yet to see Wing IDE
crash because of a flaw in the Python interpreter or its standard libraries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a id="mixed-language-development" name="mixed-language-development">Mixed-language Development</a></h3>
<p>Python is almost always fast enough but we did run into a few cases where the
interpreter did introduce too much overhead. The Wing IDE debugger and the
source code analysis engine both contain modules that engage in extremely CPU
intensive processing. These modules needed to be written in C in order to
squeeze out as much speed as possible. Fortunately, Python is designed to make
it quite easy to call back and forth between Python and C or C++.</p>
<p>In most cases, we wrote and debugged code first in Python, and then converted
by hand into C. This approach worked well for us. Working initially in Python
was much more efficient and the conversion process relatively painless.</p>
<p>Analysis of our records shows that 360 days were spent on 77K lines of Python
code and 300 days (almost as much) on 44K of C, C++, or other code. From our
experience with code conversions, we believe it is roughly correct for most
types of performance-critical code to equate one line of Python with ten lines
of C or C++ code. This means that about 5-10% of our application functionality
is in C or C++ and the rest is in Python. Even considering that the C/C++ code
is somewhat more complex than most of the Python code, these results confirm
without any doubt that working in Python is far more productive than working
in C or C++.</p>
<p>In hindsight, we believe that we could have converted smaller units of code
into C, by writing more general data-driven processing engines, and by more
carefully selecting code to convert instead of converting whole modules at a
time. Our primary goal for Python in the future is to be able to use it more
often, even in performance-critical sections of code. This effort should
benefit from projects like <a class="reference" href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/">pyrex</a>, which allows the use of Python-like code in
the development of compiled extension modules, and <a class="reference" href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/">psyco</a>, which is a
just-in-time compiler for Python.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="quirks" name="quirks">Quirks</a></h2>
<p>There are just two quirks that affected our development with Python. The
relative impact they had on our project was tiny compared to Python's benefits
but for balance we feel they are worth mentioning:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Like Java and other languages, Python occasionally deprecates old
features, or fixes minor bugs in a way that can potentially break existing
code. This is done over the course of a number of releases, so that
programmers will first see deprecation warnings, and only later be impacted by
the change. We ran into this only once when Python 2.0 began to disallow
multiple arguments to the sequence append method. This problem required changing
exactly three easily found calls in our code base of over 77K lines of Python.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Different versions of Python can produce incompatible compiled byte code
and requires that C/C++ extension modules are compiled against a specific
version of Python. For example, while Python 2.2.2 works happily with Python
2.2.1 or 2.2.0 byte code and extension modules, it will print warnings and may
run into problems running against those compiled against Python 2.1.x or
earlier. There are solid technical reasons behind this design choice, but it
does require some additional work when packaging applications for distribution
to users running different versions of Python. In the Wing IDE debugger, we
solve the problem simply be storing separate directories for each interpreter
version and importing modules accordingly at runtime. For the IDE itself, we
solve it by shipping with a specific Python interpreter included; a task
that's easily accomplished with support found in the Python standard library's
distutils package.</p>
<p>No other language we have used has been this devoid of quirks, even those we
have used much less intensively and across fewer language revisions.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2><a id="conclusion" name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Without Python, we could not have sustained the Wing IDE development effort
long enough to produce what is now a successful software product. Python has
been more productive, robust, and portable than any other technology we have
tried. Through our experiences providing technical support for the IDE, we
know that we are not alone in these assessments. Feedback from our customers
often includes strong endorsements for the productivity of Python, Wing IDE,
and related technologies such as Zope.</p>
