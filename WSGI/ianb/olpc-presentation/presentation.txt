One Laptop Per Child
====================

One Laptop Per Child: laptop.org

    "It's an education project, not a laptop project."

    -- Nicholas Negroponte

Developing World
================

Why OLPC instead of:

* Food
* Clean water
* Medicine
* Electricity
* Cell phones
* Text books
* Teachers

Why OLPC
========

This is not happening:

.. raw:: html

   <fieldset>
    <legend style="font-size: 0.5em; color: #777">save the world 2.0</legend>
    In which way do you want to save the world?<br>
    <input type="checkbox" style="height: 2em; width: 2em" checked> Feed all the starving people<br>
    <input type="checkbox" style="height: 2em; width: 2em"> Give all the children laptops<br>
    <input type="submit" style="font-size: 1em" value="Make it so!">
   </fieldset>

No one is asking us to choose between these.  No one is asking us at all.

What's Really Wrong
===================

* Total production of food is enough to feed everyone.
* Famine almost always is preceded by **war** not just *drought*.
* The World Bank estimates that $800 billion are lost to corruption each
  year [1]_.  $2-3 billion in Nigeria each year. [2]_
* We cannot *save* the third world.
* We could start by doing no harm, but no one is asking any of us
  *that* question either.

Why OLPC
========

Why?

* Because **we can**

* Because **someone will**

* Because **now is unique time**

Why
===

    "This is not just a matter of giving a laptop to each child, as if
    bestowing on them some magical charm. The magic lies within-
    within each child, within each scientist-, scholar-, or
    just-plain-citizen-in-the-making. This initiative is meant to
    bring it forth into the light of day." 

    -- Kofi Annan

Countries
=========

* Brazil
* Argentina
* Nigeria
* Libya
* Thailand
* Uruguay
* Rwanda

The Hardware
============

* "XO"
* AMD Geode 433MHz processor
* 256 Mb RAM
* 1 Gb internal flash drive
* 6" x 4.5" screen
* 1200x900 b&w resolution
* 800x600 color resolution
* Camera, 640x480 30FPS

Power
=====

* Battery: NiMH 16.5 Watt-hours, LiFeP 22 Watt-hours, 2000 cycles
* Average (target) 1 Watt power consumption
* Flexible power input (10-20V, safely handles -40-39V)
* No hand-crank :(

The Deployments
===============

* Teachers receive a laptop

* School server:

  + Internet connection (*fingers crossed*)

  + 300Gb hard drive

  + Multiple configurations possible

  + 100% humidity in parts Brazil and Nigeria

  + 105 degree F in parts of Libya

Education
=========

* For 6 to 16 year olds
* Laptop follows child (even after school)
* "Constructivist" educational principles
* Learning by doing
* Peer teaching
* Emphasis on process not outcome
* Not copying the clerical education in US schools

Economics
=========

* $150 laptop should last 5 years
* Laptop cost goes down over time (laptop power doesn't go up)
* Textbooks can cost $20/year (paper alone)

The Software
============

* UI is called "Sugar"
* Written in Python, C, C++
* UI based on GTK event loop, Cairo vector graphics (hippocanvas),
  Dbus for inter-process communication
* "Telepathy" for communication (based on Jabber)
* Gecko (Mozilla) based browser
* *Not* a single-runtime environment
* Also Smalltalk / Squeak / EToys

UI Principles
=============

* Avoid words:

  - Need translation

  - Some countries are multilingual

  - Laptops intended for pre-literate children

* Still localized:

UI Principles
=============

* "Activities" instead of "Applications"
* Focus on the action, not the tool

UI Principles
=============

* No overlapping windows
* There's not enough room
* Distracting
* Except chat

UI Demo
=======

(demo here)

UI Principles
=============

* Collaboration in all activities
* Multiple users working on a single document

.. image:: mesh-share.jpg

Security
========

* Applications run in isolated environments
* Users do not have passwords

Storage
=======

* There's still a boring filesystem
* The filesystem is for programs, not for people
* The filesystem is a perfectly good hashtable
* The filesystem is not a good document storage system

Storage
=======

* Documents should be versioned
* Documents should be well indexed
* We don't trust activities anyway, so activities don't get access to
  files, only users get access to files
* ... So we have to rethink some of the UI anyway
* ... So we can change how documents are access by software and
  intercept all changes

Storage
=======

* The "Journal"
* Shows a history of *actions*
* Some actions have artifacts
* The artifacts are documents
* The *process* is educational, the documents aren't really
  (an overstatement)

Storage
=======

Software Status
===============

* A lot of work yet to do
* Core system is stabilizing
* The web is available, acts just like normal
* Locally-hosted web applications will work
* Installation is hard -- use images!

Chicago
=======

* I'm in the process of setting up a local group
* Give me your email and I'll subscribe you once it is setup
* http://laptop.org
* http://wiki.laptop.org
* http://chipy.org  (Python in Chicago)
