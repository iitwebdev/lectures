<h1>Welcome to Clippy!</h1>

<p>
WebClippy is a system to provide help on web pages.  It's this
floating bar right here.  With it, you can provide instructions
about what a person should do on the web, in that screen right down
there.
</p>

<p>
To go to the next slide, hit that little button <a
href="#next"><img src="#next"></a> (or hit the link right there).
</p>

<hr>

<h1>What Clippy Does</h1>

<p>
As you see, you've advanced to the next slide.  You can still
go <a href="#prev">back</a>.  Or continue on to the next slide.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>What Clippy Doesn't Do</h1>

<p>
You'll notice Clippy doesn't do is advance automatically.  Or figure
out what you are doing.  Or keep you from going back.  It's pretty
simple -- just a set of slides.
</p>

<p>
They are HTML slides, so of course you can still include any HTML in
them that you want; <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and of course
everything else (tables, etc).  You can <a
href="http://openplans.org" target="docFrame">link to a page</a>
with <code>&lt;a href="..." target="docFrame"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>What Clippy Is Like Inside</h1>

<p>
Clippy slides are separated with horizontal rules, aka
<code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>.  The magic backward and forward links just
link to the anchors <code>#next</code> and <code>#prev</code>.  Or
link to a page with <code>#(number)</code> like <a href="#2">this</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Invoking Clippy</h1>

<p>
If you look at the URL up there, it points to
<code>frame.html</code>.  This is an empty frame, which Clippy fills
in using the parameters <code>doc</code> (the starting document) and
<code>help</code> (this help document).
